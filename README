Hyper Books Intro
=================

Hyper Books is a free mobile web based eâ€‘book reader. The  available books (added to git repo) are a selection of copyright free classics from digital libraries such as Project Gutenberg in Australia, Germany and the USA. Goal was to provide an attractive alternative to Amazon Kindle, B&N Nook and Apple iBooks. A live version can be viewed at http://hyper-books.com/

Quickstart
==========

Clone the repository into your webserver root, create a database called "hyper_books" in your mysql database, open php/config.php and provide your database credentials. Then open http://localhost/hyper_books/dev.html in your browser. I strongly recommend using dev.html for development since it is using the not minimized css/js files and is therefore better suited for development. 

Architecture
============

The project has an HTML5 based front-end. Its using a HTML5 database to store downloaded books on the device for fast access and offline availability. The front-end is supporting simple click and go as well as touch based interactions. It keeps track of your reading progress and your current book. 

The server provides a list of available books. Since parsing of books on the client side can consume a lot of time the backend is also providing a service to deliver a pre-parsed book formatted for the readers device.
