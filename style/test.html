		How does it work? Well, we first exclude IE by wrapping the links in a simple conditional comment. Then we’re using some CSS3 media queries to target each device specifically. Safari on the iPhone responds to a max-device-width of 480px, and Safari on the iPad seems to respond best when both min-device-width and max-device-width are used in the query. Together, these media queries apply styles in either portrait or landscape orientation.

		Target iPad & iPhone from within your existing stylesheet

		Using external stylesheets to target iStuff works great, but the extra HTTP requests can reduce performance. To avoid this, we can apply iPad/iPhone-specific CSS using our existing stylesheet. You know, the same one that we’re using for Firefox, Opera, and other desktop browsers. After much experimentation and testing, here is what I found that works:</div>
		<div id='next' class='page'></div>
	</div>
</body>
